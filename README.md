Calculating e (Euler's number) via Monte Carlo method in ancient programing languages (before 1991). To contribute to this project, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeekk/e-for-dinosaurs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before filing a PR



Implement the following pseudocode (Python3) or something like it to get Euler's number

```python
import random

print("Number of iterations: ", end="")
n = int(input())

sum_total = 0
for _ in range(n):
    temp = 0
    counter = 0
    while temp < 1:
        temp += random.random()
        counter += 1

	sum_total += counter

print(sum_total/n)
```
